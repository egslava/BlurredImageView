This project uses [Manabu-GT EtsyBlur](https://github.com/Manabu-GT/EtsyBlur) project for applying fast blur on ImageViews in your android application. While Manabu-GT is used for bluring Bitmaps that project provides easy integration with bluring ImageViews in your Android App this library gives you a super simple integrations with blurred ImageViews.

Requirements
-------------
API Level 8 (Froyo) and above.

Setup
------
The library is pushed to Maven Central as an AAR, so you just need to add the followings to your ***build.gradle*** file:

**Announcement**: [let's travel the world](https://github.com/egslava/edittext-mask/issues/65)! or let's just be guests :)

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'ru.egslava:blurredview:1.0'
}

android {
    defaultConfig {
        renderscriptTargetApi 22
        renderscriptSupportMode true
    }
}
```

Usage
------
```java
<ru.egslava.blurredview.BlurredImageView
    ...
    android:src="@drawable/..."
    app:radius="0.3"
    app:keepOriginal="true"
    app:downSampling="2" />
```
 - radius - "blureness" [0..1]
 - keepOriginal - (default false). if set to false you can't make image sharper if you change radius to less value. If it set to false every time you change radius it will blur already blured image. If `keepOriginal` set to true it will blur original instead of blurred image. Of course to keep original you need more memory so if you need to have just statially blurred image just keep it with default value.
